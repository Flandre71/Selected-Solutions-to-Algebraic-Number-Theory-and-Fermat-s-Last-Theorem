# Selected Solutions to *Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem*

My personal selected solutions to *Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem*. Since most of those books were read by myself, correctness might not be guaranteed and this repo is for reference only.

Solutions were made using [TexMacs](https://www.texmacs.org/), saved as `.tm` files. May switch to $LaTeX$ in the future.
